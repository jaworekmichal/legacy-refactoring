/**
 * Production at day of expected delivery is quite complex:
 * We are able to produce and deliver just in time at same day
 * but depending on delivery time or scheme of multiple deliveries,
 * we need to plan properly to have right amount of parts ready before delivery time.
 * <p/>
 * Typical schemas are:
 * <li>Delivery at prod day start</li>
 * <li>Delivery till prod day end</li>
 * <li>Delivery during specified shift</li>
 * <li>Multiple deliveries at specified times</li>
 * Schema changes the way how we calculate shortages.
 * Pick of schema depends on customer demand on daily basis and for each product differently.
 * Some customers includes that information in callof document,
 * other stick to single schema per product.â€¨By manual adjustments of demand,
 * customer always specifies desired delivery schema
 * (increase amount in scheduled transport or organize extra transport at given time)
